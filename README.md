## System Architecture

### MVC Pattern
- **Models**: User, Paper, Question, Enrollment, Result, StudentAnswer
- **Controllers**: PaperController, StudentController, QuestionController, ResultController, AuthController
- **Views**: Blade templates for all user interfaces

### Database Schema
Key tables: users, papers, questions, enrollments, student_answers, results

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- **Teachers**: Paper creation, question management, scoreboard access
- **Students**: Exam enrollment, test-taking, result viewing

### Methodologies
- **Agile-Scrum Hybrid**: Short sprints within broader epics
- **Feature-Branch Git Workflow**: Isolated development with peer review
- **Database-Centric Design**: Normalized relational schema
- **MVC Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns
